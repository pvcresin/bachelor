In this thesis, I propose a new interaction technique, WristSlide,
which operates a smartwatch with one hand 
by sliding the wrist on the desk, wall, your own body and so on.
To make continuous input like a swipe to a smartwatch equipped with a touch screen, 
it is necessary to operate with the hand opposite to the hand wearing it.
Therefore, using a compact wireless mouse embedded in the band, 
our system acquires the amount of movement of the wrist in the state of being in contact with the object, 
enabling two-dimensional input with one hand.
I devised two methods A and B which differ in the direction of sliding the wrist 
and conducted a pointing task using experimental prototype.
The results indicate that both methods follow the Fittsâ€™s law, 
and the operation time is significantly shorter for method A.
Moreover, the operation time tended to be different 
depending on the direction in which the wrist is moved.
Based on these results, I showed an example application.
